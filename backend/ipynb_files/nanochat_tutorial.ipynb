    "# Part 1: What is a Language Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 The Big Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're writing a text message: \"I'm going to the...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Your brain can predict what comes next: \"store\", \"park\", \"movies\", etc. A **language model** does the same thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "A **Large Language Model (LLM)** is a computer program that:\n",
    "1. Reads a lot of text (books, websites, articles)\n",
    "2. Learns patterns in how people write\n",
    "3. Uses those patterns to predict what word comes next\n",
    "4. Generates human-like text by predicting one word at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Big is \"Large\"?\n",
    "- **nanochat (our version)**: ~500 million to 2 billion parameters\n",
    "- **GPT-2** (2019): 1.5 billion parameters\n",
    "- **GPT-3** (2020): 175 billion parameters\n",
    "- **GPT-4** (2023): Estimated 1+ trillion parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A **parameter** is like a tiny piece of knowledge the model learns. More parameters = more knowledge capacity!\n",

    "### The Magic Formula:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Text Input → Model → Predicted Next Word\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Part 2: Understanding the Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ The Building Blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT and nanochat are built using something called a **Transformer**. Think of it as a sophisticated pattern-matching machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Tokens** (The Words)\n",
    "Before the model can read text, it breaks it into \"tokens\" - small pieces of text.\n",
    "- Example: \"Hello, world!\" → [\"Hello\", \",\", \" world\", \"!\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Embeddings** (The Meaning)\n",
    "Each token gets converted into a list of numbers (a vector) that represents its meaning.\n",
    "- Similar words have similar numbers\n",
    "- Example: \"cat\" and \"dog\" have similar embeddings because they're both animals\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Attention Mechanism** (The Focus)\n",
    "This is the most important innovation! When processing a word, the model looks at ALL other words to understand context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example sentence: \"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired.\"\n",
    "- When processing \"it\", attention helps the model know \"it\" refers to \"animal\", not \"street\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Layers** (The Depth)\n",
    "The model has many layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer:\n",
    "- Looks at the text from a different perspective\n",
    "- Extracts more complex patterns\n",
    "- Builds deeper understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "Our nanochat model has 20-34 layers!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Prediction Head** (The Output)\n",
    "At the end, the model outputs probabilities for what word comes next:\n",
    "- \"store\": 35% probability\n",
    "- \"park\": 25% probability\n",
    "- \"movies\": 20% probability\n",
    "- etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🎓 From Zero to ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "Training an AI chatbot happens in several stages. Think of it like teaching a child:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Learning to Read (Tokenization)\n",
    "**What happens:** We teach the model how to break text into pieces (tokens).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Just like you learned the alphabet before reading, the model needs to learn its \"alphabet\" of text pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Input: \"I love pizza!\"\n",
    "- Tokens: [\"I\", \" love\", \" pizza\", \"!\"]\n",
    "- Token IDs: [314, 1842, 16462, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Base Training (Pretraining)\n",
    "**What happens:** The model reads millions of documents and learns to predict the next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** FineWeb - a huge collection of high-quality web pages\n",
    "- Size: ~90 billion characters (for our speedrun version)\n",
    "- That's like reading 45,000 novels!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training Process:**\n",
    "1. Show the model text: \"The sky is\"\n",
    "2. Model guesses: \"green\" (wrong!)\n",
    "3. Tell the model the correct answer: \"blue\"\n",
    "4. Model adjusts its internal parameters\n",
    "5. Repeat billions of times!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** A model that can predict text, but doesn't know how to have conversations yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 3: Midtraining\n",
    "**What happens:** We teach the model about conversations and special tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New Skills:**\n",
    "- Understanding chat format (user says something, assistant responds)\n",
    "- Learning to use tools (like a calculator)\n",
    "- Answering multiple-choice questions\n",
    "- Developing a personality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Training Data:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: What is 2+2?\n",
    "Assistant: 2+2 equals 4.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4: Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)\n",
    "**What happens:** We show the model examples of really good conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Make the model:\n",
    "- More helpful\n",
    "- More accurate\n",
    "- Better at following instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: Explain photosynthesis to a 5-year-old.\n",
    "Assistant: Plants are like tiny chefs! They use sunlight as their energy \n",
    "to cook up food from air and water. The recipe makes food for the plant \n",
    "and releases oxygen that we breathe. Cool, right?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 5: Reinforcement Learning (Optional)\n",
    "**What happens:** The model practices tasks and gets rewarded for correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1. Give the model a math problem\n",
    "2. Model generates an answer\n",
    "3. Check if the answer is correct\n",
    "4. Give a reward (like a gold star!) if correct\n",
    "5. Model learns to maximize rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** Better performance on specific tasks like math problems!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Timeline\n",
    "- **Tokenization:** 5-10 minutes\n",
    "- **Base Training:** 2-3 hours (the longest part!)\n",
    "- **Midtraining:** 20-30 minutes\n",
    "- **SFT:** 10-15 minutes\n",
